Capacious Labs - The one-man idea lab of Tejbir Wason
=============

Capacious is an incubator for ideas that combine the power of hardware and software to solve challenging problems in a variety of fields. This lab serves as a sandbox for my hacks. Here, new ideas get conceived, formalised, executed and distributed. I am a team of one with a simplistic approach to reach from idea to product. Let the experiments begin!
